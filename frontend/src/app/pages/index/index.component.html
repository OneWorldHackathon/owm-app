          <h2>What is the One World Marathon?</h2>
          <p>One World Strong Foundation embodies the core principles of connection and co-operation, supporting
              the belief that people around the world should work together toward common goals.</p>
          <p>To reinforce that message, we’ve proposed a marathon, where teams of participants from around the
              world will combine their efforts to achieve a total of 26.2 miles (or 42.195km) over a four-day
              event. Participants apply and sign-up for a distance they will contribute on the event dates.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
          <h2>Who can participate?</h2>
          <p>All are welcome, but we especially encourage young people to participate through their schools,
              colleges and universities, to reinforce the value of making connections, showing curiosity toward
              other cultures and collaborating toward common goals.</p>
          <p>The event is open to all abilities, assisted or unassisted, mobility impaired, teams or individual
              participants. We aim to have someone from every country in the world participate.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
          <h2>What’s your ultimate aim from the event?</h2>
          <p>One World Marathon's main objective is to connect people across borders and diverse backgrounds. 
              We encourage teams that represent multiple continents, countries, and cultures. We hope to inspire
              people to see the benefits of
              working together as a global community and encourage others to develop similar projects.</p>
          <p>In the long term, we aim to implement a strong, unified, virtual platform, whose
              message of connectivity and openness contradicts the basic premises of racism,
              bigotry, violent extremist and terrorist rhetoric. Furthermore, we endeavor to
              promote a healthy and active lifestyle, global interconnectivity and resiliency
              for individuals and communities impacted by trauma.</p>

          <p>Simply fill in the form below to enter. How you achieve your distance is up to
              you!</p>
          <p>All participants will be part of a team. The minimum number needed to create a
              team is 2 participants, there is no maximum number. If your team goes over
              the 26.2 miles that is OK!</p>
          <p>Your distance can be achieved by any type of movement that you are capable
              of: walk, run, roll over the course of the 4-day event. Participants may be
              assisted or unassisted. If an individual is assisted, both participants may count
              their distances and register as separate teammates. A participant may also join
              multiple teams and contribute separate distances to each team.</p>
